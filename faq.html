<h2 class="contentBox">The purchase</h2>

<h3>The description on the store is "ok", but i need to know more about the package. Is it ok if i ask you via mail or using the forum thread?"</h3>

Of course, you can ask me whatever you want. I would recommend you to use the email (the fastest way).

<h3>Ups! I bought the asset, but i feel like this is not for me/my game. Please could you give me a refund?</h3>

No, I'm more than willing to share (100% honestly) all the information you require from the package. I'm open for questions 24/7, i can give you code examples, show you videos/gifs, whatever you need to make sure you're purchasing the asset you need for your project.

<h3>So, Do you give refunds at all?</h3>

Yes i do. The reason behind must be well justified, though. For instance, if i say to you (via mail, asset description, etc.) "Yeah, <u>that feature</u> you are asking for is included in the package", then you import the package and realize it's not there. That would be a good reason for a refund. The "Ups! this is not for me" is so lame, that i do not consider those as justifications at all. <strong>You've been warned</strong>.


<h2 class="contentBox">About the content</h2>

<h3>
What is "Character Controller Pro"?
</h3>

<p>
    Character Controller Pro is a 2D/3D Dynamic Capsule based character controller/system.
    <ul>
        <li>The character controller allows you to handle the movement, rotation and size of your character (among other things) in a precise way.</li>
        <li>The character system (also called "implementation") is built on top of the character controller. It main purpose is to give you some nice and extensible components (character states and abilities, input detection, AI, etc.) allowing you to quickly create your gameplay elements, without reinventing everything from the ground up.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h3>What is a Character Controller?</h3>

<p>
A character controller is a script (or set of scripts) that handles all of your character requierements (being the movement the most obvious one). Due to the vast variety of games out there, it is not possible to determine a unique general solution for everyone. CCP was (and will be) designed to work as a multi purpose character controller, trying to cover as much ground as possible.
</p>

<h3>What type of character does CCP support?</h3>

<p>
Currently it only supports an upright capsule based character. This basically means that the vertical direction of the capsule will always be transform.up. 
</p>

<h3>Can i used this asset with my 2D scenes as well?</h3>

<p>
Yes, CCP supports 2D and 3D Physics, as well as 2D and 3D movement.
</p>

<h3>What do you mean by a "dynamic" character?</h3>

<p>
In the simulated physics world (especially with Character Controllers),  there are kinematic and dynamic rigidbodies (each one having its own advantages and disadvantages). CCP uses a dynamic approach to physics, this means that the character is built upon a dynamic rigidbody working with Unity's Physics. The movement is performed by modifying the velocity of the rigidbody directly.
</p>

<h3>What type of games can i make with CCP?</h3>

<p>
Any game that requires a physics based capsule shaped character. A RTS game, a 2D platformer, a horror game, a first person shoter, etc.
</p>

<h3>Why the package is divided in "Core" and "Implementation"?</h3>

<p>
The reason behind this decision is extensibility. The full package is defined as Core + implementation. The implementation is built upon the core, so, if you want to re-implement this part, or removing it for complete, you just need to delete one folder and you are good to go. It also serves as a good way to define the scope of each part.
</p>


<h3>Can i create a character using any arbitrary scale?</h3>

<p>
No, CCP currently supports only <1,1,1> scale. If you need to scale your character you should scale the graphics object (what you actually see on screen, the renderer component), then modify the character body size to fit the graphics.
</p>

<h3>My character consists of a big alien spider that has a weird shape (a composition of colliders), each leg must be procedurally animated and should react to the environment in a particular way. Can this asset handle that?</h3>

<p>
It won't (like 99.9% sure). If that was the case this asset would be called "Super Alien Spider Controller Pro". This package is oriented to what most developers need, the capsule character being the most common case, vastly used for a humanoid character (or whatever you want to put inside).
</p>

<h3>So, Why should I consider to buy this asset?</h3>

<p>
There are a couple of reasons why, here are some:

You require a capsule based character that mimics the good stuff from the Unity's Character Controller component, but also works in a Physics environment.
You want to create characters for your 2D and/or 3D game and only pay for one unified asset (otherwise you will probably have to buy two different assets with no connection between them whatsoever).
You need a character controller solution for your project but don't want to waste so much time and money in the process (believe me, this type of asset requires time and research ... a programmer will charge you a lot for it).
You want a serious, always growing asset that will be maintained and supported.
</p>

<h3>So, Why should I consider not to buy this asset?</h3>

<p>
If you have in mind a very specific character (e.g. the alien spider), or maybe you are experimenting with the character physics in your own unique way to create your unique game (maybe this is what you need, who knows), in this case i can't guarantee this package is for you. If you want to be 100% percent sure please contact with me, i will tell you honestly is this is for you or not.
</p>

<h2 class="contentBox">Versions of the package</h2>

<h3>Can i get an older version of the package?</h3>

<p>
Yes! I keep a backup with all the released versions of CCP. For me to send you the required version I will need your invoice number first (no exception).
</p>

<h3>I downloaded the last version of Unity, and your asset doesn't work with it. Could you please do something about it?</h3>

<p>
Of course! before you go and write a 1 star review please let me know about your specific problem (include all the related errors/warnings in the message). Unity is adding and deprecating stuff like crazy, if something doesn't work with the new stuff let me know about it and i will fix it. It will help you, me and others.
That said, I always test my assets on new <strong>official versions</strong> of the Unity editor, just to be 100% sure.
</p>

<h3>Spanish is my primary language, not english, What can i do to contact with you?</h3>
<p>
Don't worry, spanish is also my primary language... En ese caso, por supuesto que puedes enviarme tus preguntas en español (será más fácil para los dos). Paralelo al hilo oficial (creado en Unity Forums), he creado un hilo en español acerca de CCP en el sitio Unity Spain, una comunidad de habla hispana dedicada a Unity. Te recomiendo que te unas si deseas preguntarme algo por allí, o simplemente para participar en el foro.
