        <h1>Releases</h1> 

        <div class="contentBox">
            <h2 >1.0.4</h2>

            <h4>Added</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Multi-triggers: This means that the character is able to recognize more than one trigger at the same time, allowing to interesting gameplay mechanics.</li>
                <li>Invert axis: Now the "InputAxes" component allows to invert the horizontal and/or vertical axis.</li>  
                <li>Interact: A new input axis ("Interact") has been added.</li> 
                <li>Camera inputs: "cameraHorizontalAxis", "cameraVerticalAxis" and "cameraZoomAxis" have been added to the input data.</li>               
            </ul>

            <h4>Changes</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The scene controller now must be added to the scene. Just drag and drop the "Scene Controller" prefab into the scene, done.</li>
                <li>The "3D Scene" scene has been modified (multiple triggers).</li>
                <li>The "Mobile Scene" scene has been modified.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Fixes</h4>                
            <ul>
                <li>Import errors: Due to some prefab missing references a bunch of errors were shown on the console when importing the package.</li>
                <li>Not grounded jump: The character wasn't reseting the available jumps count.</li>
                <li>Material vs trigger: When entering a non-material trigger the character was resetting its material data (default material).</li>
                <li>Camera 3D: The camera was looking at a wrong target position.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="contentBox">
            <h2 >1.0.3</h2>

            <h4>Added</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>CharacterActorBehaviour: The character actor component now runs its own "behaviour" before anything else (ensuring a correct execution order). The CharacterStateController has been converted into a CharacterActorBehaviour.</li>
                <li>Contacts: The PhysicsComponent now is capable of collecting all the contacts (in a frame) from the OnCollisionEnter and OnCollisionStay callbacks.</li>
                <li>Collision response contacts: The CharacterActor now contains a list of contacts that come from OnCollisionEnter callbacks, due to dynamic rigidbodies that use the "Contact Rigidbodies" tag. This is used to create the external velocity in the NormalMovement state.</li>
                <li>Max. Rigidbody response velocity: The response velocity now can be clamped to a maximum value.</li>
                <li>Debug Gizmos toggle: The CharacterActor allows to show/hide the gizmos.</li>                
            </ul>

            <h4>Changes</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Character Graphics: This component does not require any external reference anymore (it will automatically get all the children).</li>
                <li>The "Performance" scene has been re-designed.</li>
                <li>Jump variables names: some of the jump-related variable names (NormalMovement component) has been changed.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Fixes</h4>                
            <ul>
                <li>Jump: The character was unable to jump when the "Jump cancellation mode" was disabled.</li>
                <li>Dash: The character was unable to react to collisions during the Dash state.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!--  -------------------------------------------------  -->
        
        <div class="contentBox">
            <h2 >1.0.2</h2>

            
            <h4>Added</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Animator: new play "Transition" and "PlayState" modes. Now the states can be use either by playing them directly (Animator.Play) or by using triggers/transitions.</li>
                <li>CharacterAnimation: the animation component is now using FixedUpdate rather than Update to handle the states.</li>
                <li>CharacterActor: new "TargetPosition" public property.</li>
                <li>CharacterActor: new "RigidbodyVelocity" public property.</li>
                <li>CharacterActor: new "RigidbodyStaticVelocity" public property.</li>
                <li>Camera3D: position interpolation is now divided into "planar" (the plane formed by the character up direction) and "up". Both interpolations can be configured separately.</li>
                <li>CharacterGraphics: rotation offset. This basically will offset the orientation of the graphics object.</li>
                <li>CharacterGraphics: "Rotation" and "Scale" facing direction modes.</li>
                <li>Character Actor and Kinematic Actor: Enable/Disable options. Now both, characters and kinematic actors, can be enabled/disabled at any time (using the classic checkbox from the inspector). These actions will freeze/unfreeze the rigidbody.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Changes</h4>
                
            <ul>
                <li>3D Scene: it has been modified a little.</li>
                <li>Demo Character: the default Demo character model has been completely replaced with a humanoid model.</li>
                <li>Crouch: it is called "Shrink" now, since it's more appropriate.</li>
                <li>Arrow modifier: it is called "Gravity modifier", since it's more appropriate.</li>
                <li>CharacterAnimation: now it uses hashes rather than strings.</li>
                <li>CharacterActor: the character will use the graphics object forward as the desired forward direction, rather than transform.forward (for3D) and transform.right (for 2D).</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Fixes</h4>                
                
            <ul>
                <li>CharacterParticles: the CharacterAnimation caused an error when the CharacterParticles component was disabled (due to a missing "PlayFootstep" method).</li>
                <li>Crouch: the character didn't change its size when standing on steep slopes.</li>
                <li>Step handling: now the step up action should be much more smoother than before.</li>
                <li>Gravity modifiers: incorrect facing direction when the character entered a gravity modifier.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <h2>1.0.1</h2>
            
            <h4>Added</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>RigidbodyComponent component.</li>
                <li>ColliderComponent component.</li>
                <li>PhysicsComponent component.</li>
                <li>CharacterBody component.</li>
                <li>New "Sphere" and "Circle" body types (CharacterBody component).</li>
                <li>A new "useGravity" toggle for the NormalMovement component.</li>
                <li>A new scene called "Performance".</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Changes</h4>

            <ul>
                <li>The CharacterMotor2D and CharacterMotor3D components were replaced by the CharacterActor component.</li>
                <li>The ActionBasedPlatform2D and ActionBasedPlatform3D components were replaced by the ActionBasedPlatform component.</li>
                <li>The NodeBasedPlatform2D and NodeBasedPlatform3D components were replaced by the NodeBasedPlatform component.</li>
                <li>The KinematicSceneController was replaced by the SceneController. Now the SceneController is responsible for updating the characters and the kinematic actors.</li>
                <li>The kinematic platforms and the cameras are now kinematic actors.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Fixes</h4>
        
            <ul>
                <li>A bug with the vertical not grounded movement (CharacterMotor). This was making the character to slowly descend (depending on the skinWidth value) even if the vertical velocity was zero.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
